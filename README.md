# UI-and-UX
This repo is all abut projects in UI/UX where UI (User Interface) is the look, feel, and interactivity of a digital product (buttons, colors, layout), while UX (User Experience) is the entire journey and feeling a user has with the product, focusing on ease, efficiency, and overall satisfaction.

The Design Process (UX → UI) 
Empathize & Research: Understand user needs and pain points through interviews and surveys.
Define: Create user personas and journey maps to outline the strategy.
Ideate & Wireframe: Map out the skeleton of the product using low-fidelity sketches.
UI Design: Transform wireframes into high-fidelity mockups with visual styling and branding.
Prototype & Test: Build interactive models to validate the design with real users
